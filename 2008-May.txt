Subject: [Destar-dev] Python 2.5 (or 2.6) and asterisk 1.6 support
Message-ID: <b7eb4a700805050950h374c05f0va34ef4bff4cf04f1@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, all:

You have never heard of me before, so let me introduce myself. I am Vernon
Cole. I have been using asterisk for about 3 years now (have unplugged the
land line at my home) and python for 5 years. I have been searching for
something better than Centos and FreePBX, and I think that you have it. I
really like the idea of destar, because it 1) is on the Ubuntu distro, and
2) the user interaction is written in python.

I have installed destar on a stock ubuntu heron machine which is my home
PBX, and now have it working, after doing enough google searching to find
the correct fixes.

There is a discussion happening now on
https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/82286
where many people are having trouble with DeStar requiring python 2.4.
(Python 2.5 is a better idea because it already has sqlite3 built in, as
does asterisk 1.6.)

I also notice that asterisk 1.4 from the ubuntu distro complains that destar
is sending out depreciated commands.

I have also set up another environment with development trunk versions of
asterisk 1.6, python 2.6, and DeStar on a test computer.  Is anyone already
working on new version support? I don't want to re-invent a wheel if someone
is already chiseling on a new version. Where is this effort at? What should
I do to help?

Hello Vernon.

We are glad you have worked with destar and made yourself a positive
opinion about it. We also think destar is a great alternative to killer
apps like freepbx, and we keep using and developing destar every day in
our company, Avatar Ltd.

Anyway, public development of Destar have been stalled for a while, not
because of its inactivity, but because of our limited time to commit to
the berlios svn the changes we make to the code.

We work with debian-etch in our installations, so we haven't really
worked on porting the code to work with python-2.5 and newer versions of
quixote.

So, wellcome, and feel free to start working on that matter.

Regards.

I believe it is quite a good time to do that if you don't want to miss
Lenny.

There are hosts of interesting features in the trunk (resolved most of
my immediate usability issues last time I looked, as the readers of this
list might recall).

This is sounding interesting.  I am willing to do the work to update to a
newer python, but it would be MUCH more productive to use a current source.
If svn is the problem, an upgrade to something more modern may be in order.
I have started messing with Bazaar which is a distributed source control
system (used by Canonical and Ubuntu) and have never heard of git. I am open
minded to anything that works.

Let's put it this way: what are the show-stoppers for basing a 0.3.0
release off current svn trunk?

Some potential release goals:

* Support for Asterisk 1.4
* Python 2.5

Some minor points to fight all day about:
- What about support for 1.6?
- When is it safe to deprecate 1.0? 1.2?
- Version control system to use

What's the smallest device DeStar has been known to run on?

Message-ID: <20080515082420.GF27523@xorcom.com>

Hi

Too lazy to grep the code and to log into the bug tracker. I noticed
that my generated extensions.conf has a few '|' that are used as
separators. In 1.6 the ',' is no longer converted to '|'. Rather, the
separator is ','. A '|' is left as-is.

In most cases simply replacing pipes with commas in extensions.conf will
do the trick and also work just as well in older version. In the few
examples I saw it worked. e.g:

[pbx1]
;Virtual PBX
exten=0,1,MixMonitor(${TIMESTAMP}.wav49|W(0))
exten=0,2,Queue(queue1|Tth)
exten=queue1,1,MixMonitor(${TIMESTAMP}.wav49|W(0))
exten=queue1,2,Queue(queue1|Tth)

Having a comma here would have worked as well in 1.2 and 1.4 .
